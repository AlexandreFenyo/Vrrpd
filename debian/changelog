vrrpd (1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New "upstream" version. Actually upstream is more or less dead and
    inactive since the version at Sourceforge does not provide patches
    developed by other maintainers (incoporated in this package). 
    In any case the Debian package is now going to be based on this one 
    (to facilitate patch development)
  * Removed the RFCs from the upstream package, to avoid reproducing
    #199816
  * Debian/copyright and control now point to sourceforge as upstream
    (Closes: #267821)
  * Ported all patches to the new code.
  * Syslog calls are now vrrpd_log calls for consistency with 1.0's code.
  * Included Sourceforge's Track Item [ 990755 ] daemon.c and -b option, only
    that I've changed it's behaviour and called it -D, by default, vrrpd
    will _not_ daemonize. It might actually be useful when an init script
    is added to the package (start-stop-daemon could be used too, of course).
  * Added more info on VRRP implementations and some other information tidbits
    in README.Debian
  * Fixed some typos in the manpage and modify BUG info to tell users to
    report bugs upstream.
  * debian/rules cleanup

vrrpd (0.7.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed typo in control file (Closes: #227669)
  * Send most error messages to the syslog with patch from Pascal Lengard,
    since this is potentially dangerous, added a note in the TODO
    since this needs further review and potentially a command line switch
    to determine wether to log to syslog or not and the debug level to use.
    (Closes: #226911)
  * Added the output of running RATS ('rats.output') in the source in
    order to do a security audit review in the near future.

vrrpd (0.7.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Minor upstream bump to force inclusion of .orig.tar.gz which was
    not properly included previously
  * Removed RFCs from package : rfc2338.txt.vrrp, 
    draft-ietf-vrrp-spec-v2-05.txt and 
    draft-jou-duplicate-ip-address-02.txt (Closes: #199816)
  * Applied patch contributed by Johann Klasek, upstream has not 
    approved it but the comment is clear enough (Closes: #199911)
  * Included alignment patch provided by Nicolas S. Dade which fixes
    bus fault on sparc (Closes: #199795)
  * Included patch from Chao-Cheng Wu which:
      - will not remove the routing table entries added after VRRP
      was started in the event of a failover.
      - will not fail if the gateway of the early routing entry is
      base on the late routing entry  (?)
    (Closes: #223859)
